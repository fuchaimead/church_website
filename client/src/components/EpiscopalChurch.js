      <p> The Episcopal Church is a part of a worldwide community of churches known as the Anglican
      Communion which grew out of the Church of England. At the time of the Reformation, the Church
      of England adopted some of the reform ideas circulating on the Continent while at the same time 
      maintaining the Apostolic Succession (the historic, unbroken line of bishops going back to the Apostles).</p>

      <p>The Church of England spread as the British Empire grew into a global empire. The Anglican Church 
      arrived in the American colonies with the first settlement in Jamestown. After the Revolution, the 
      Protestant Episcopal Church was formed by many of the same Founding Fathers who had recently formed
       our new nation. Then, by sending Samuel Seabury, William White, and Samuel Provoost back to Scotland 
       and England to be consecrated bishops, the Apostolic Succession was maintained, and in 1789, the 
       Book of Common Prayer of the Protestant Episcopal Church was adopted.</p>

      <p>Today, we are in communion with the Church of England but do not come under its authority.</p>
