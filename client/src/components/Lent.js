      <Header>The Story of Lent</Header>

      <p>Lent is the period of forty days which comes before Easter in the Christian calendar. 
      Beginning on Ash Wednesday, Lent is a season of reflection and preparation before the 
      celebrations of Easter. By observing the forty days of Lent, Christians replicate Jesus 
      Christ's sacrifice and withdrawal into the desert for forty days. Lent is marked by fasting, 
      both from food and festivities.</p>
      <p>Whereas Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus after his death on the cross, 
      Lent recalls the events leading up to and including Jesus' crucifixion by Rome.</p>
      <p>The Christian churches that observe Lent in the 21st century (and not all do significantly)
      use it as a time for prayer and penance. Only a small number of people today fast for the 
      whole of Lent, although some maintain the practice on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. 
      It is more common these days for believers to surrender a particular vice such as favorite 
      foods or smoking. Whatever the sacrifice it is a reflection of Jesus' deprivation in the 
      wilderness and a test of self-discipline.</p>

      <Header>Why 40 days?</Header>
      <p>40 is a significant number in Jewish-Christian scripture:</p>
      <p>In Genesis, the flood which destroyed the earth was brought about by 40 days and nights of rain.
      The Hebrews spent 40 years in the wilderness before reaching the land promised to them by God.
      Moses fasted for 40 days before receiving the ten commandments on Mount Sinai.
      Jesus spent 40 days fasting in the wilderness in preparation for his ministry.
      Most Christians regard Jesus' time in the wilderness as the key event for the duration of Lent.</p>
      Why is it called Lent?
      And why the color purple?

      Lent is an old English word meaning 'lengthen' and is observed in the spring, when the days begin 
      to get longer.
      Purple is the symbolic color used in some churches throughout Lent for drapes and altar frontals. 
      This color is used for two reasons: first, because it is associated with mourning and so anticipates the pain and suffering of the Crucifixion, and second, because purple is the color associated with royalty, and celebrates Christ's resurrection and sovereignty.

      East and West:
      Both the Eastern and Western churches observe Lent but they count the 40 days differently.

      In the Western church (Roman Catholic and Anglican), Lent excludes Sundays (which are celebrated 
      as miniature Easters) whereas in the Eastern church (the various Orthodox Churches), Lent 
      includes Sundays.
      The two Churches also start Lent on different days. Western churches start Lent 40 days 
      (not counting Sundays) before Easter. Since Easter is always on a Sunday, 40 days prior is 
      always a Wednesday. Thus, Lent starts on Ash Wednesday. Eastern churches start Lent on the 
      Monday of the 7th week before Easter, and end it on the Friday nine days before Easter. 
      Eastern churches call this period the 'Great Lent'. The last week of Lent is called Holy Week.
